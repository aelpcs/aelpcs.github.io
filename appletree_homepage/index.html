	<h3>Our Mission</h3>
	<p>AppleTree Early Learning Public Charter School (AELPCS) is committed 
	to providing a high quality education for all students in the District of Columbia. 
	We firmly believe that, through high quality instruction and intentional supports for students, we can close the achievement gap before kindergarten -- ensuring all students have the social, emotional and cognitive foundations to succeed. As this is our commitment to our students, we recognize that we must also provide and train high quality teachers to support our mission.  The teaching fellow program creates the opportunity for AELPCS to give new teachers the training and skills necessary to provide high quality instruction for preschool and preK students in an urban setting.</p>

			<p>After spending two years in our program, children show significant academic and social gains. AppleTree alumni recognize 25 percent more letters in kindergarten and have better oral reading fluency in first grade (scoring 20 points higher on tests) than their non-AppleTree peers. Additionally, AppleTree alumni are stronger oral readers by second grade (70 percent higher).</p>
